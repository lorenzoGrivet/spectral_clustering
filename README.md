# Spectral Clustering Project

This project, developed for the *Computational Linear Algebra for Large Scale Problems* course (A.Y. 2024/25), implements and compares clustering algorithms on two datasets.
The focus is on **Spectral Clustering**, analyzed alongside **K-Means**, **Hierarchical**, and **DBSCAN** methods.
